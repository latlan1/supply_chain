# supply_chain

## Description
Repo with Python Jupyter notebooks tacking supply chain problems using Bayesian approaches.

## Problem 1: Estimate Supply needed from each supplier to meet selling demand
- Parameterize the yields from multiple suppliers
- Define objective function based on supply-demand
- Estimate supplier yields based on Bayesian models
- Optimize total yield and price based on estimated yields
- Check out the supply_chain_optimization.ipynb for more!

## Problem 2: What price should I sell my website for?
- Fit Bayesian Logistic Model to small dataset
- Explore the effect of various features on the Probability of selling website
- Optimize over model to find best listing price
- Check out the website_sell_price_optimization.ipynb for more!
